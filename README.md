Below is our project UML and our Output Example Based on Our Specific Articles

Overall we have a ReadingFiles Method that cleans and converts the files to array lists, from there we have a calculations method that calculates the amount of words in the articles and the statistics that calcualtes statistics and sorts the word frequency using a bubble sort algorithm on a pair of lists.

Finally our Handler Method handles all steps towards getting the final output repeatedly which we then create a new object of Handler in main which allows for a customized output in main with little input required from a user. 

 We have recently implemented an article comparitor that determines the article with the richest vocabulary and a calculation for the articles positivity or negativity score.
